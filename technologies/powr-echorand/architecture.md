### Algorithm

`agreement` class is the main algorithm implementation class - an interface for external use.

The class implements the following functionality:

* storage of configuration parameters, such as:
  * parameters for the algorithm operation \(maximum number of steps, timeouts, etc.\);
  * **$Q \(r-1\)$** initial value \(random variable from the previous block\);
  * **$HB \(r-1\)$** initial value \([SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash address of the previous block\);
  * access interface to public keys of the relevant parties for verifying the signature;
  * block validation interface;
  * each party's private keys on the node.
* configuration settings;
* start-up and shutdown of the algorithm operation as a whole.

As part of the algorithm operation:

* start of rounds;
* storing links to the rounds;
* suspension of a round to add a new block to the database blockchain;
* initial reception of network messages and their transfer to the corresponding rounds;
* providing the rounds with links to specific interfaces, through the adapter implementation.

### Round

All steps of the algorithm are implemented within the context of a particular round.

Each round has its own number.

Functionality:

* owns all its steps and shared data. Algorithm steps generate the shared data, save and exchange them, where necessary, through the round;
* receives network messages from `agreement` and transfers them to the corresponding step of the algorithm;
* forwards network messages to the other nodes in accordance with the algorithm described in the [technical description](https://github.com/echoprotocol/echowiki/tree/7e7b42766726e2150633d834f12c21d7f3d3ed60/technologies/powr-echorand/echorand%20/%20tech/README.md);
* runs the steps of the algorithm;
* waits for the notification of a step suspension and decides on the start of the next step or the end of the round;
* notifies `agreement` about its suspension.

The round can be ended only from the `bba` steps.

The result of the ended round is the new block's signature and, optionally, the new block itself.

If the round is ended without a block, a new round starts, while the ongoing round is waiting for a new block to arrive launching a specific `step_finish` step. The decision is made by `agreement`, analyzing the operation results of the round that sent the notification of suspension.

It should be noted that theoretically there might be a situation where there are several rounds in `step_finish`, and thus several blocks. Via the network there can arrive the block **n**, while the block **n-1** is still in `step_finish` - tail fragmentation blockchain. Such a situation should be foreseen in the `agreement` class. For example, by entering a variable of the state of the round, which takes the following values:

* gets implemented;
* waits for a block;
* waits to be added to blockchain.

### Steps

Each step of the algorithm must be implemented asynchronously, responding simultaneously to the timer events and events of the network, such as network messages arrival.

Each step of the algorithm has its own number.

All steps of the algorithm are divided into groups: `gc`, `gc-bba` and `bba`, each of which shows significantly different behavior.

The steps of the `gc` group start all together with the start of the round and work simultaneously.

The only `gc-bba` group step starts after the end of the last step of the `gc` group.

> This refers to the last step by number, not the last step that was ended.
>
> However, the timeouts for the steps are chosen in such a way that the last step by number actually becomes the last ended step of the group `gc`.

The steps of the `bba` group start immediately after the end of the `gc-bba` step and work sequentially, one after the other till the end of the round, or till reaching a certain step limit. The step limit for the group `bba` is set from the outside of the algorithm implementation, as a configuration parameter.

### Auxiliary functionality

#### Algorithm parameters

The structure used during the initialization of the `agreement` class and for the subsequent storing of parameters inside the class. In general, it's always possible to get the `agreement` from the structure privately.

#### Messaging Interface

It can be implemented as a separate interface.

Also, if you have a base class for all network messages, it can be also implemented through a simple transfer of a functor to the `agreement` class. Pretty much like this:

```cpp
using network_sender_t = std::function<bool (const graphene::net::echorand_message&)>;
network_sender_t _send_message;
bool send_message(graphene::net::echorand_message& msg) { _send_message(msg); }
```

#### Interface for creating a new block

At the end of the round `agreement` class should add a new block to the local database.

For interacting with the `Graphene API`, the same mechanism as with the messaging interface can be envisaged.

```cpp
using block_handler_t = std::function<bool (const graphene::chain::signed_block&)>;
void send_message(const graphene::net::echorand_message& msg) const noexcept;
```

#### Interface for the block validation check

During the operation of the algorithm, it's necessary to check the validation of the arrived block. Basically it means to check its transactions using the `Graphene API`.

Such an interface can also be implemented like the interface for creating a new block described in the previous point.

```cpp
using block_handler_t = std::function<bool (const graphene::chain::signed_block&)>;
void check_block(const graphene::chain::signed_block& block) const noexcept;
```

#### Interface for getting information about the involved parties

At the start of the round, and at the start of the following series of the `bba` steps, you will need to receive a list of the involved parties with their keys. Local parties on the network node need a pair of keys - a private and a public one, for remoted parties only a public key is required.

Such an interface can also be implemented like the one described in the previous point.

```cpp
using witness_getter_t = std::function<witnesses_t (unsigned, unsigned)>;
witnesses_t get_witnesses(unsigned round_id, unsigned step_id) const noexcept;
```

#### Network message classes

Get implemented separately within the corresponding `Graphene API` modules.

If `Graphene API` allows, it's better to implement the message classes as a hierarchy:

```text
graph TD;
  echorand_message-->echorand_gc_proposal;
  echorand_message-->echorand_gc_signature;
  echorand_message-->echorand_bba_signature;
```

### Initialization

The object `agreement` is created in the `graphene::app::application` class constructor using the `echo::randopt` structure.

The `graphene::app::application` class controls the switching on and off function of the `agreement` algorithm rounds depending on the block synchronization process activity. If necessary, it changes **Q\(r-1\)** Ð¸ **HB\(r-1\)** in the parameters of `agreement` after synchronization before running the algorithm.

`graphene::app::application` class transfers all the messages coming through the `echorand_message` network to the `agreement` class.

It's also required to consider modifications of the private keys of the involved parties on the node in the `agreement` class parameters.

Since the `fc::schedule` interface is used, all the rounds and steps should be created like the `std::shared_ptr`, must be inherited from `std::enable_shared_from_this<...>` and, when scheduling an event from the timer, must use the following scheme:

```cpp
auto pThis = shared_from_this();
fs::schedule( [pThis, this](){ onTimer(); }, timeout );
```

which will be done in the base class of the step, for the timer functionality implementation.

### Functioning

After the start, the `agreement` class creates a round. In the constructor the round creates three steps: `step_gc1`, `step_gc2`, `step_gc3`.

The steps are run automatically, by a round. In their corresponding constructors, if necessary, they produce the necessary preliminary calculations and become scheduled for the timers.

The algorithm receives network messages from the application and sends them to the corresponding round with their relevant number. The round sends them to the specified step, in accordance with the step number in the message.

As soon as a result of a network message or when the timer goes off a step decides to end, it saves the results of its work in a round. After this, the step marks the fact that it's over inside itself and reports this to the round. Then, the round removes this step from its collection.

Most likely, the end of the step will be a result of a network message. In this case, the event will still be recorded on the timer and, therefore, will keep the step in memory. Unfortunately, in the `Graphene API` the timer functors cannot be canceled and they always work. In this case, after the timer goes off, the processing event will see that the step is marked as completed and will simply exit. As a result, the step will be removed from memory.

Another option is to stop the algorithm. In this case, the `Graphene App` application library calls a method of ending the algorithm. This method will remove all the rounds. The rounds will remove all the steps, marking them as completed. In case some steps remain registered on the timers, after a while they will be removed from memory, as it is described above.

### Other Terms

* **Executor** - the network account selected in the step of the round for performing a specific consensus action
* **Local configuration** - a certain set of parameters accessible only to the running network node.
* **Base \(database\)** - a blockchain with a certain set of blocks, possibly "lagging behind" the state of most other network nodes. It stores public EDS keys of all the participants of the algorithm operation.
* **Participant** - a set of EdDSA private/public keys and an account balance within the **Echo** network. Basically

  it's an **Echo** network user, specially registered on a specific network node. A user can be registered as a participant

  only on a single network node at a given time. A network node permits registration of several participants.

### Getting started

#### 0. Preparation

**Input data**:

* $Q_{r-1}$ from $CERT_{r-1}$

The round $R\_r$, which launches step 1 and step 2, described below, is created.

#### 1. Candidate blocks generation

**Input data:**

* $H\(B_{r-1}\)$ from $CERT_{r-1}$
* $A\_1$, $N\_1$ from the context of the round

**Start:**

Right after determining $CERT\_{r-1}$

**Steps:**

1. **Verification**:
   1. If $N\_{1} = â$, complete the step
   2. Select participant index $n â N_{1}$, which generates the smallest $Q\_r = sig\(Q_{r-1}, r\)$, as a creator of new block on the node

#### 2. Leader selection \(voting\)

**Input data**:

* $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $N\_{2}$ from the context of the round

**v** - local structure to store information about leader candidate: producer ID and corresponding block hash.

The empty set symbol assigned to the elements **v** means "empty block" and "unknown leader". In the application, it can be a predefined constant or a separate flag in the data structure.

**Start:**

right after defining $CERT\_{r-1}$

**Steps:**

1. **Timer**: schedule the timer after the time equal to $2 \* Î»$, by a trigger:

   2. if the local cache for $l$ has the block $B\_{r}$
      1. $v = \{ ctx\[l\].H\(B\_{r}\), l \}$
      2. go to **Communication**
2. **Timer**: schedule the timer after the time equal to $Î» + Î$, by a trigger:
   1. $v = \{ â, â \}$
   2. go to **Communication**
3. **Network**: subscribe to network messages `gc_block`, `gc_signature` at the start of a step
   1. after receiving a message `gc_block` of the round $r$

         4. verify the block signature using `producer-id` of the block
         5. verify $HB_{r-1}$ from the block for equality to the local one from $CERT_{r-1}$
         6. verify the correctness of $PAY\_{r}$ in the block
      6. If $ctx\[msg.id\]$ already exists
         1. verify $ctx\[msg.id\].H\(B\_{r}\) == H\(msg.block\)$
      7. If it does not exist, save `msg.id, msg.block` to the context of the round:
         1. $ctx\[msg.id\].B = msg.block$
         2. $ctx\[msg.id\].H\(B\_{r}\) = H\(msg.block\)$
      8. if $l$ defined and $l == id$:
         1. $v = \{ ctx\[l\].H\(B\_{r}\), l \}$
         2. go to **Communication**
   2. after receiving a message `gc_signature` of the round **r**
      1. verify the round number in the message
      2. verify that $msg.id â A\_1$ and get the user's public key
      3. verify the signature of the whole message
      4. $msg.block\_hash = â$: verify `msg.rand` for equality to the local one from $CERT\_{r-1}$
      5. $msg.block\_hash != â$: verify the signature `msg.rand` using $Q\_{r-1}$ from $CERT\_{r-1}$
      6. Save $msg.id =&gt; â$ in the context of the round, if itâs not saved yet:
         1. $ctx\[msg.id\].B = â$
         2. $ctx\[msg.id\].HB = msg.block\\_hash$
         3. $ctx\[msg.id\].rand = msg.rand$
4. **Communication**: generating, signing and sending of messages
   1. stop timers, **do not** unsubscribe from network messages
   2. if $N\_{2} = â$, end the step
   3. $ân_{2} â N_{2}$:
      1. get real userâs ID in the blockchain: $id_2 = A_{2}\[n\_{2}\]$
      2. sign with the key of $id\_{2}$ and send
         1. if $v != â$: `gc_proposal` = { r, 2, $id\_2$, v }
         2. if $v == â$: `gc_proposal` = { r, 2, $id\_2$, â }

It should be collected in the context in the previous step, as a result of `gc_block` and `gc_signature` message processing. 1. $â ctx\[msg.leader\]$ - a record for such a potential leader exists in the context 1. $ctx\[msg.leader\].H\(B\) == msg.block\\_hash$ - the block hash coincides 1. $ctx\[msg.leader\].v3.push\(msg.id\)$, where $v3$ is unordered\_set 1. if the counter is more than the threshold $t_{h}$: $ctx\[msg.leader\].v3.size\(\) &gt; t\_{h}$ 1. `v = { msg.block_hash, msg.leader }` 1. go to **Communication**

### Reaching the Binary Byzantine Agreement \(BBA\)

There are several classes of algorithms for reaching the Byzantine Agreement. The one which is used in **echorand** is based on the use of a shared random value.

The central idea of the algorithm is the following. At each step of the algorithm, network nodes Ñan be divided into two sets:

1. nodes that received a sufficient number of messages during the previous round\(s\) \(with a certain equal value\), allowing them to offer this value as a solutions.
2. nodes that received two solution variants and can not give preference to either of them.

In the latter case, undecided nodes use VRF to generate a shared random value from the `{0, 1}` set for making and sending their decisions. And since the random value will be the same for all the "uncertain" nodes, all such nodes will make just the same decision.

Designations used for data storage:

* `bba0` - messages with a `non-empty` block and a vote equal to `0`
* `bba1` - messages with a `non-empty` block and a vote equal to `1`
* `bbae0` - messages with an `empty` block and a vote equal to `0`
* `bbae1` - messages with an `empty` block and a vote equal to `1`

3. **Communication**: like in step $5$

#### Nodes that have completed the round

Problem:

* a node has already completed the round
* the other nodes are still performing the subsequent steps

If the node, that has already completed the round, should send $bba$ messages to the subsequent steps with evaluation \(which means, that $N\_{s}$ in it is non-empty at some subsequent steps\), then the choice of such a node, that has completed the round, must somehow be among the other nodes.

Solution: Step $bba$ emulation

**Input data**:

* last value $b$
* selected block $v = \{ block\\_hash, leader \}$
* if there are no messages from the previous step and the other nodes - complete the step and the round
* otherwise:
  1. register the messages from the other nodes for the current round/step
  2. if $N\_{s} != â$, send the `bba_signature` messages with their choice

### Getting a new block by all the members of the network

All the network nodes perform the round steps. Messages are sent to the network only by the nodes that have already their participants selected at a given step using the $VRFN\(r,s\)$ algorithm.

Thus, all the network nodes reach the end of the round at one of the stages of the $BBA$ algorithm and get a formed $CERT\_{r}$.

If the value $ctx\[l\].B != â$, then the block is received. If the value $ctx\[l\].B == â$, then:

* $ctx\[l\].signQ == Q\_{r-1}$ means that an empty block has been created.
* $ctx\[l\].signQ != Q\_{r-1}$ means that a non-empty block has been created and the node has not received it.

### Fallback service

In rare cases, a number of active network nodes may be below $t\_h$. In such a case ECHO network will always generate empty block. To prevent this behavior, root committee is introduced. If network node, participating in round steps, is inactive - selected committee member will generate appropriate step message on behalf of this member.

In such a case message will have non-empty **fallback** field and message itself will be signed by the key of committee member.

Handling of such messages will be done at appropriate steps with prioritizing of originally generated messages.

Prioritizing can be done in both ways:

* **GC related steps** - wait original messages and collect fallback ones too. After some timeout fallback messages will be taken into account.
* **BBA steps** - fallback messages collected and counted as original ones. Original messages override fallback ones if any.

## Network interaction

### Message format

Each message is entirely signed with the EdDSA key of the participant who creates the message, i.e, basically, there is always a `message_signature` field in a message.

Separate fields or groups of fields are also signed with an EdDSA key of the participant who creates the message.

Such a "double" signature is essential, since the signatures of certain groups of fields are later used in VRF to generate a random round value, and in the signature set $CERT\_{r}$.
