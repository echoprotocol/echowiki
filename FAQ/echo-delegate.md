### What is ‘Echo delegate’ and how to become one?

Your account can delegate another account to send messages on your behalf. This consensus algorithm is called ‘Delegated Proof-of-Stake’. Under it, you delegate an authorised node to send messages for you and get your share of the reward for it. You can view this delegate’s ID in the object of your account. By default, your delegate is the account that registered you, but you can change this delegate for another one.
