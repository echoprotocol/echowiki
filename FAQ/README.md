## General questions about Echo’s Network

### What is Echo?

Echo is a layer 2 overlay network that integrates with existing blockchains to provide interoperability and new advanced scripting features for crypto assets. Similar to how the internet is built in different communication layers and protocols, Echo creates an entirely new layer of communication enabling high-speed assets transfers and runs new types of decentralized applications or "smart contracts" to interact with existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most used, most valuable, and most liquid cryptocurrency. Rather than competing with them as a store of value or currency, Echo integrates with Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable new types of complex applications.

### What blockchains does Echo work with?

Currently, Echo interoperates with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum assets such as ERC-20 tokens. In the future, Echo can connect to and supportunique foundational blockchains.

### What is layer 2 and why Echo is different from other layer 2 solutions?

Layer 2 is used to describe projects and protocols that build on the foundation of existing blockchains to provide new functionality. Some examples include the Lightning network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum. While many popular Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network focus on off-chain transactions or transfers using the same asset, Echo's goal is to connect many different blockchains and enable new functionality with the underlying blockchain assets.

### What are the utilities of this network?

Echo Ecosystem consists of the following solutions and products:

  * Echo Explorer
  * Echo Desktop Wallet
  * Blip - Echo Light Desktop Wallet
  * Echo Bridge
  * Special tools: Echo JS Libs, Python libs, Echo DB, IOS and Android Mobile Frameworks, SwiftySSS

### How do end users benefit from Echo?

- Echo gives for Users a low cost of computing resources and high transaction speed due to Proof of Weighted Randomness Consensus mechanism (PoWR);
- Echo support Bitcoin and Ethereum sidechains with enabling interoperability of the two networks within an innovative ecosystem for skyrocket DeFi;
- Echo is a fully cross-chain interoperable ecosystem with the ability to share, see, and access information across different networks without needing for intermediaries;
- Echo is built and scaled to contribute to the ever-growing decentralized economy where each single user becomes a payment processors and all decisions within the scalability network are made by a consensus of the network participants
- Echo gives a convenience and freedom transactions where each node are involved in decision-making process proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency it holds
- Echo support compatibility with Solidity & EVM for easy launching Ethereum-based DApps and deploy smart contracts with minimal-to-zero changes
- Echo has a high resistance to blockchain forks and reorganizations, and strength to any malicious actions by any network actors, including failure to propagate messages and sending contradictory messages

### How does Bitcoin and Ethereum interexchange to eBTC and eETH?

Echo implements a 2-way pegged sidechain ("bridge") that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and use BTC and Ethereum with applications on the Echo network. Echo's sidechains work through a 2-way peg to the native blockchain. For example, for Bitcoin, this means that BTC is deposited into a multisig address and a corresponding amount of Echo BTC, or eBTC, is minted on the Echo blockchain to the user who initiated the deposit. The new eBTC can be user to interact with a smart contract, traded on a decentralized exchange, or transferred to another user. When the eBTC needs to be converted back to BTC, it can be locked into a contract and the corresponding amount of BTC will be released on the bitcoin chain. The protocol ensures that the same BTC cannot be valid on both blockchains at the same time.
The same processing is for Ethereum, or eETH.

### Does Echo have a token?

Echo supports a wide range of assets and tokens, including native assets, sidechain assets, and contract-controlled tokens. Echo has a core asset, the ECHO token, which is used for the security mechanism of the consensus algorithm. ECHO tokens are also used as a type of “gas” fee currency, to protect the network against spam or DDOS attacks. The ECHO tokens is inflationary and used to reward full nodes for participating in EchoRand consensus.

### Who controls Echo? How can I get more information to participate?

Echo is developed by Pixelplex, a leading international blockchain development firm. Since 2013, Pixelplex has been developing smart contract protocols including Bitshares, Qtum, and Vechain. After building 50 different projects on different protocols including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitshares, Qtum and EOS, the Pixelplex team created Echo to enable deeper interoperability between these platforms. Echo is led by by Alex Dulub, the founder of PixelPlex and Tyler Evans, the co-founder of BTC.
Echo Network is controled by Echo Committee members. Members of the committee is carefully selected. Since network development depends on the actions of the committee, all committee members should be interested in the successful development of the sidechain in particular and the project in general. One of the main factors here is the need for all committee members to keep a certain amount of Echo tokens staked in the system. Each active committee member must maintain the Echo blockchain and the Bitcoin/Ethereum blockchains (full node) in active and synchronized state. This means that the node of each active committee member oversees the main chain network and checks blocks for transactions that are affecting the sidechain.
The committee members are not only responsible for ensuring the stable operation of the sidechain mechanism, but also have to sustain an up-to-date status of the committee itself. It is the committee members themselves who decide which of the participants should be added to the committee, or who should be excluded from it using Echo blockchain special operations.
You may also participate in Echo Network as Committee member, Producer or Verifier by trying the Echo wallet, joining the network with running your own Echo node, contributing to our open source repositories, or by building your first application using Echo according to "How to" tutorial.
The full list of current Committee members you can see on the Echo Explorer portal

### Is Echo decentralized?

Similar to existing blockchain protocols, the Echo network is open for anyone globally to join, permission lessly and voluntarily, by running the open source Echo node software. Anyone can become an Echo validator or block producer. The decentralization value is increasing as more people with validating nodes use Echo.

### Is there a set date for Echo and it’s sidechains to go live?

Nowadays, the Echo network is running on a stable test network ("testnet") that has been active for 24 months and has been under active development to create the desktop wallet, mobile wallet, node software, browser extension, developer libraries, and block explorers necessary to interact with the network.
The Echo MainNetwork will launch in October 2020

### Do I need ECHOs to use the Echo Network?

No, you can download the Echo wallet and begin sending and receiving other assets without requiring any ECHO. Transaction fees can be paid in many different currencies and are converted into ECHO by the protocol’s underlying fee pools. Additionally, decentralized applications in Echo can pay for their own execution, so that users aren’t required to individually pay transaction fees.

### What is staking and how do I start using it?

Staking means you contribute to transactions validation before they are added to a block. Thus, you participate in the consensus mechanism. Any Echo account holding a minimum-required balance of tokens can do staking if it runs an echo_node with an authorized account attached to it.

### What is ‘Echo delegate’ and how to become one?

Your account can delegate another account to send messages on your behalf. This consensus algorithm is called ‘Delegated Proof-of-Stake’. Under it, you delegate an authorised node to send messages for you and get your share of the reward for it. You can view this delegate’s ID in the object of your account. By default, your delegate is the account that registered you, but you can change this delegate for another one.

### How to lock your Echo funds to participate in staking?

To increase your chances to get a reward, you have to lock (freeze) your funds in the system for a certain period of time. The more you lock and the longer is this period, the bigger are your chances to participate in the process.

### How to register a token in the Echo network?

First, you have to create an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Then, you can register this token in the Echo network. For it, call the method [register_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#register_erc20_token-account-eth_addr-name-symbol-decimals-broadcast). For this purpose you should specify the account that will be the owner of the token, the address of the contract in Ethereum, the name of the token in Echo, which token will have an abbreviated name in Echo and precision. That to check the registered token, please, use the following methods [get_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_erc20_token-eth_addr_or_id) and [check_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#check_erc20_token-id).

## Bitcoin and Ethereum Sidechains

### What is a sidechain?

A sidechain is a method of representing an asset (such as Bitcoin) from it's native blockchain onto a new blockchain infrastructure. A sidechain is typically created through a 2-way peg, where some assets are locked on e original chain before the corresponding assets are created on the destination chain. Examples of other sidechains include Liquid and RSK for Bitcoin and POA Network for Ethereum.

### How do Echo sidechains work?

Similar to other production sidechains, Echo's sidechains work through a 2-way peg to the native blockchain. For Bitcoin, this means that BTC is deposited into a multisig address and a corresponding amount of Echo BTC, or eBTC, is minted on the Echo blockchain to the user who initiated the deposit. The new eBTC can be user to interact with a smart contract, traded on a decentralized exchange, or transferred to another user. When the eBTC needs to be converted back to BTC, it can be locked into a contract and the corresponding amount of BTC will be released on the bitcoin chain. The protocol ensures that the same BTC cannot be valid on both blockchains at the same time.

### Is Echo compatible with Bitcoin?

Yes, Echo supports BTC through a federated, pegged sidechain.

### Is Echo compatible with Ethereum?

Yes, Echo currently supports ETH and it's corresponding Echo asset - eETH.

### Is Echo compatible with ERC-20 tokens?

Yes. Echo supports all ERC-20 standard Ethereum assets and allows them to moved on and off Echo through the Ethereum sidechain.

### How does the Bitcoin and Ethereum sidechains work?

Echo Bitcoin sidechain allows Echo account owners to exchange their BTC with the corresponding asset in the Echo network (eBTC). User operations on the Echo chain and transactions on the Bitcoin chain trigger the processes inside the sidechain which result in various Echo operations and Bitcoin transactions signed and sent by the committee members.
Echo Ethereum sidechain allows Echo accounts owners to exchange their Ether and ERC20 tokens with the corresponding eETH asset or tokens on Echo network. A special smart contract is deployed into the Ethereum network by committee members which controls the deposited funds and tokens and provides an interface to manage them. The Ethereum sidechain tracks the events emitted by this contract and performs corresponding operations on the Echo side after the block where the transaction with the emitting call is located and confirmed on the Ethereum network.
In order to transfer ERC20 tokens from and to the Echo chain, ERC20 tokens should be registered in Echo network. Registration of the Ethereum ERC20 token deploys an ERC20 smart contract in Echo
network and informs the sidechain to listen to the events of the connected ERC20 token on the Ethereum side. When a token is transferred to a deposit address on the Ethereum chain, a corresponding amount of related tokens on the Echo side will be transferred to the user’s account.

### Why are these sidechains federated? What are the Echo benefits?

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most popular and secured sidechains backed by fiat currencies. They have their own pros and cons which are increased and covered for users by Echo Networks.
Bitcoin can be implemented in an environment where participants absolutely do not trust each other, anyone can join the network, as it is a permissionless blockchain, but at the same time BTC has high costs of computing resources, low transaction speed (up to 10 min), whereas, for comparison, Echo Network has a low cost of computing resources, high transaction speed (up to 3 sec), and a fixed inflation value at 10% per annum.
Despite the fact that one of the main functional blocks of Echo is implemented on the basis of Ethereum (EVM) which not need complicated and unnecessary calculations and has high performance, the projects have significant differences.
First of all, there is a consensus. The Echo consensus (EchoRand) has a number of differences from classic PoW or PoS, the purpose of consensus is to minimize the entry threshold for participants in this consensus. EchoRand does not require significant capacity or frozen large sums in order to be a member of the consensus. The result of this approach is a high level of decentralization of the network and at the same time low fees.
Another feature of Echo that distinguishes it from Ethereum is the Dual Payment Layer mechanism. The "classic" ERC20 token is a unique solution for a large number of tasks. However, this approach has a serious drawback - the transfer of tokens requires an additional payment in Ethereum, and, accordingly, the presence of only one token in the user does not allow him to use it. To solve this problem in Echo, there are two mechanisms - the ability to create your own assets with the ability to pay a commission in them, as well as the ability to create a Contract Fee Pool to pay a commission for using the contract by other users. Both of these mechanisms are described in more detail in the Whitepaper.
In addition, do not forget about Sidechains - a mechanism for decentralized connection of third-party blockchains to the Echo network.

### How do Echo blockchain compare with other close and similar blockchain projects such as EOS, Cosmos, Polkadot and Algorand?

EOS
Echo is not a computing power lease unlike EOS. The goal of the system is a high level of decentralization while maintaining high transaction processing speed. The role of the committee in Echo is more of an observer than an executive - the committee is empowered to maintain the network in the event that the number of active participants at the moment does not allow the network to operate independently.
Cosmos and Polkadot
Echo is not a third-party gateway for providing inter-blockchain connectivity, regardless of what it may be, while Cosmos and Polkadot blockchains only serve as third-party gateways.
Echo is a full-fledged blockchain with its own consensus, virtual machine and assets. Unlike direct gateways between blockchains, Echo provides the ability to use blockchain connectivity in order to implement business logic at the junction of different consensus and cryptocurrencies, and not on the side of one of them.
Algorand
When comparing Algorand and Echo, it is worth assuming a comparison of the consensus mechanisms (Algorand and EchoRand), since the rest of the functional block is very different. EchoRand is based on Algorand, but has a number of additions and changes to make the network more resilient to the decline in active network members. In particular, the key difference is the ability to delegate participation in the consensus, the participation of the committee in the formation of the block, as well as the optimization of network interaction between nodes.

### How do Echo compare with other projects such as Rootstock, Liquid and Lightning Network?

The purpose of the Rootstock (RSK) sidechain is to provide the ability to use smart contracts for the Bitcoin network via a 2-way peg as a linking mechanism between the two chains. RSK has a different consensus mechanism from Echo - merge-mining, which makes it possible to maintain the operation of the network through the use of capacities when mining Bitcoin.
Liquid can be seen as the second layer for the Bitcoin network, which enables fast yet secure Bitcoin transfers.
Apart from a different consensus, the fundamental difference between these projects and Echo is the visibility that the sidechain provides to the connected blockchain.
In the case of RSK or Liquid, we are expanding the functionality of Bitcoin, but are still locked within the network. Echo, on the other hand, makes it possible to go beyond the Bitcoin network and implement business logic, which will include the interaction of several blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
Echo is suitable for large scale payments, whist Lightning Network is designed to handle small to medium-sized transactions.
In addition, the Lightning Network has the main problem of centralization of payment hubs, which is quite similar to miner centralization, whereas Echo Network has minimal risks of centralization of hubs in accordance with the PoWR consensus and EchoRand mechanism. Plus all transactions are tracked by the Echo's main channel, that eliminating privacy issues that arise in the Lightning Network.

### How can Echo's key performance metrics compare with other blockchains?

Transactions per second (TPS)
Echo  - 1000.00
Bitcoin  - 3.81
Ethereun - 13.39

Minimum time between blocks
Echo  - 5 s
Bitcoin  - 608 s
Ethereun - 13 s

Maximum blocks per day
Echo  - 17 280
Bitcoin  - 142
Ethereun - 6 529

### Can more eBTC and eETH be issued than there are BTC and ETH on the network?

No, More or less eBTC and eETH cannot be issued on the Echo network than BTC and ETH on the network, their amount doesn't change.

### What happens to held assets if Echo’s Network stops functioning?

In case all Echo's Network participants stop their nodes and do not participate in the formation of blocks, the EchoRand consensus will continue to work as long as the Committee members are active. The Echo Failover mechanism implies the possibility of delegating the release of blocks to the accounts of committee members at the very least.

## Technical Address

### How does Echo’s PoWR consensus mechanism work?

The Proof of Weighted Randomness (PoWR) is a Byzantine agreement protocol, where a small committee of block producers or block validators are chosen randomly from the entire set of network actors. Verifiable random functions (VRFs) are leveraged to select block producers and block validators, enabling consensus to be achieved quickly without a requirement for every node to independently execute all computation, lowering the resources required for each validating node.
The likelihood of being randomly selected for the committee is proportional to a user’s balance of tokens. This committee exists only for a single block, and a new committee is randomly chosen for each new block of transactions. The network remains secure as long as at least 33% of tokens are held by honest actors.
The major goal for the EchoRand consensus mechanism is to reduce the amount of explicit synchronization needed for reaching consensus in a distributed ledger.
EchoRand allows for a greater degree of decentralization through the involvement of all users in the consensus process, produces trust through verifiable randomness and delivers performance by limiting the proportion of users required for consensus in each round.
EchoRand consists of three main steps:
- Cryptographic Sortition
- Block Generation
- Best Block Voting and Application
EchoRand also introduces a novel incentive and delegation scheme to increase network security.
See more about Echo PoWR Consensus in Whitepaper [link]().

### How is EchoRand different from DPoS blockchains?

Unlike traditional delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains, there is no superset of elected or delegated "supernodes" that produce and validate each block. Instead, every node in the network participates in block production and verification when chosen randomly, according to it's account balance.

### How does Echo address the "nothing at stake" problem?

Because EchoRand selects only a small subset of nodes to verify each block, those nodes must reach byzantine agreement about the validity of the block. That means that it is not possible for nodes to "stake" for different competing blocks simultaneously, mitigating the "nothing at stake" scenario. If the block verifiers don't reach byzantine agreement or general consensus about which block to add, no block is appended to the chain.

### What languages does/will Echo support?

Echo compatible with the following programming languages: Ada, C/C++, D, Eiffel, Go, Haskell, Pascal, Python, Rust, Solidity, and more.

### How many transactions per second will the Echo Network withstand?

1000 TPS

### What are the requirements to run an Echo node?

The Echo node software can be run on any consumer grade hardware, including a Raspberry Pi. Current minimum resource requirements are 1+ GHz CPU, 1 GB RAM and 10 GB of storage, as well as a 5mbps internet connection. View instructions for running an Echo node here.

### What is the transaction confirmation time?

5 sec

## Network Security

### How is the Echo blockchain secured?

Echo uses a dynamic, open committee rather than a fixed (private/permissioned) federation of known companies to secure the sidechain. Because of this, Echo improves the trust model and security of the Bitcoin and Ethereum bridge.
Like many byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms, Echo requires an honest majority of 2/3 + 1 to reach consensus and confirm a given block. If that consensus is not met, an empty block is added to the chain and a new set of block producers and verifiers are chosen for the next block. Rather than an attacker with 51% of hash power being able to disrupt or cause a reorganization as in proof of work blockchains, at attacker would need to acquire a 67% of the total ECHO balance, and the probability of this case is extremely low.

### How does Echo secure pegged sidechain assets?

At any time, you can independently verify that the amount of a sidechain asset like eBTC or eETH matches the amount of secured on the Bitcoin and Ethereum chains.

### How does the blockchain prevent double spend attacks?

The security of the Echo Sidechain with respect to the double waste of funds (on the main chain side or the sidechain side) point is based on two aspects:
1. To avoid possible main chain forks all blocks should be processed with reasonable lag, 12 blocks for the Bitcoin chain and 20 blocks for the Ethereum chain. Hereinafter we will refer to the transaction as confirmed in the main chain if it has received the above mentioned number of confirmations in the chain.
2. From the Echo side, this security is guaranteed by EchoRand, which reduces the probability of network forks to an extremely low level.

### How does the blockchain prevent loss of access to funds?

The loss of access to funds (on the main chain side or the sidechain side) situation is covered with the ability to manually create transactions and transfer funds out of the address/account controlled by the committee and 24 hours delay in processing the deposits/withdrawals.
In addition to that sidechain, it includes decreasing after some predefined time the number of signatures required to withdraw funds and ability to cancel the deposit transaction during 24 hours for the Bitcoin sidechain.

### How many confirmations are required for consensus? Why are the lower requirements enough?

Echo requires an honest majority of 2/3 + 1 to reach consensus and confirm a given block. If that consensus is not met, an empty block is added to the chain and a new set of block producers and verifiers are chosen for the next block.
The likelihood of being randomly selected for the committee is proportional to a user’s balance of tokens. This committee exists only for a single block, and a new committee is randomly chosen for each new block of transactions. The network remains secure as long as at least 33% of tokens are held by honest actors.

### What are Echo’s plans to diversify nodes to avoid network centralization?

Echo Network provides an opportunity to participate in Consensus for almost any account, and due to the delegation mechanism, everyone can recruit additional accounts for themselves. Accordingly, the incentive to launch nodes is the opportunity to earn more. 
Also, Echo's Token Economy implies itself that if blocks are skipped due to the lack of a transaction or an insufficient number of verifiers, the "unplayed" reward will be distributed over time, so the maximum profit can be potentially obtained by staying in Echo Network for a long time.

## Agenda for Adoption

### What type of innovations will Echo projects add to the industry?

- Echo Network is a fully cross-chain interoperable ecosystem with the ability to share, see, and access information across different networks without needing for intermediaries.
- Echo supports Bitcoin and Ethereum sidechains with enabling interoperability of the two networks within an innovative ecosystem for skyrocket DeFi where each node are involved in decision-making process proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency it holds.
- Echo proposes high resistance to blockchain forks and reorganizations, and strength to any malicious actions by any network actors, including failure to propagate messages and sending contradictory messages

### What type of relationship will Echo have with other blockchains?

Echo’s mission is to ensure individuals worldwide the freedom to self-organize, communicate, and transact freely. Echo does this by building an overlay network that enables existing cryptocurrencies to interact with user-friendly decentralized applications.
Echo's overlay network is the infrastructure and developer platform necessary to create and deploy high-performing and user-friendly decentralized applications that build on top of leading protocols.Echo supports honest partnerships in the blockchain industry and doesn't act like a tough competitor in relation to similar blockchain projects.
Echo uses industry best practices and approaches to provide the community with a new solution and solve existing problems or disadvantages of other blockchain products for achieving key industry goals in blockchain security and performance.
