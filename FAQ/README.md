### What is Echo?

Echo is a layer 2 overlay network that integrates with existing blockchains to provide interoperability and new advanced scripting features for crypto assets. Similar to how the internet is built in different communication layers and protocols, Echo creates an entirely new layer of communication enabling high-speed assets transfers and runs new types of decentralized applications or "smart contracts" to interact with existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most used, most valuable, and most liquid cryptocurrency. Rather than competing with them as a store of value or currency, Echo integrates with Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable new types of complex applications.

### What blockchains does Echo work with?

Currently, Echo interoperates with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum assets such as ERC-20 tokens. In the future, Echo can connect to and supportunique foundational blockchains.

### What is layer 2 and why Echo is different from other layer 2 solutions?

Layer 2 is used to describe projects and protocols that build on the foundation of existing blockchains to provide new functionality. Some examples include the Lightning network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum. While many popular Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network focus on off-chain transactions or transfers using the same asset, Echo's goal is to connect many different blockchains and enable new functionality with the underlying blockchain assets.

### What are the utilities of this network?

Echo Ecosystem consists of the following solutions and products:

  * Echo Explorer
  * Echo Desktop Wallet
  * Blip - Echo Light Desktop Wallet
  * Echo Bridge
  * Special tools: Echo JS Libs, Python libs, Echo DB, IOS and Android Mobile Frameworks, SwiftySSS

### How do end users benefit from Echo?

- Echo gives for Users a low cost of computing resources and high transaction speed due to Proof of Weighted Randomness Consensus mechanism (PoWR);
- Echo support Bitcoin and Ethereum sidechains with enabling interoperability of the two networks within an innovative ecosystem for skyrocket DeFi;
- Echo is a fully cross-chain interoperable ecosystem with the ability to share, see, and access information across different networks without needing for intermediaries;
- Echo is built and scaled to contribute to the ever-growing decentralized economy where each single user becomes a payment processors and all decisions within the scalability network are made by a consensus of the network participants
- Echo gives a convenience and freedom transactions where each node are involved in decision-making process proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency it holds
- Echo support compatibility with Solidity & EVM for easy launching Ethereum-based DApps and deploy smart contracts with minimal-to-zero changes
- Echo has a high resistance to blockchain forks and reorganizations, and strength to any malicious actions by any network actors, including failure to propagate messages and sending contradictory messages

### How does Bitcoin and Ethereum interexchange to eBTC and eETH?

Echo implements a 2-way pegged sidechain ("bridge") that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and use BTC and Ethereum with applications on the Echo network. Echo's sidechains work through a 2-way peg to the native blockchain. For example, for Bitcoin, this means that BTC is deposited into a multisig address and a corresponding amount of Echo BTC, or eBTC, is minted on the Echo blockchain to the user who initiated the deposit. The new eBTC can be user to interact with a smart contract, traded on a decentralized exchange, or transferred to another user. When the eBTC needs to be converted back to BTC, it can be locked into a contract and the corresponding amount of BTC will be released on the bitcoin chain. The protocol ensures that the same BTC cannot be valid on both blockchains at the same time.
The same processing is for Ethereum, or eETH.

### Does Echo have a token?

Echo supports a wide range of assets and tokens, including native assets, sidechain assets, and contract-controlled tokens. Echo has a core asset, the ECHO token, which is used for the security mechanism of the consensus algorithm. ECHO tokens are also used as a type of “gas” fee currency, to protect the network against spam or DDOS attacks. The ECHO tokens is inflationary and used to reward full nodes for participating in EchoRand consensus.

### Who controls Echo? How can I get more information to participate?

Echo is developed by Pixelplex, a leading international blockchain development firm. Since 2013, Pixelplex has been developing smart contract protocols including Bitshares, Qtum, and Vechain. After building 50 different projects on different protocols including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitshares, Qtum and EOS, the Pixelplex team created Echo to enable deeper interoperability between these platforms. Echo is led by by Alex Dulub, the founder of PixelPlex and Tyler Evans, the co-founder of BTC.
Echo Network is controled by Echo Committee members. Members of the committee is carefully selected. Since network development depends on the actions of the committee, all committee members should be interested in the successful development of the sidechain in particular and the project in general. One of the main factors here is the need for all committee members to keep a certain amount of Echo tokens staked in the system. Each active committee member must maintain the Echo blockchain and the Bitcoin/Ethereum blockchains (full node) in active and synchronized state. This means that the node of each active committee member oversees the main chain network and checks blocks for transactions that are affecting the sidechain.
The committee members are not only responsible for ensuring the stable operation of the sidechain mechanism, but also have to sustain an up-to-date status of the committee itself. It is the committee members themselves who decide which of the participants should be added to the committee, or who should be excluded from it using Echo blockchain special operations.
You may also participate in Echo Network as Committee member, Producer or Verifier by trying the Echo wallet, joining the network with running your own Echo node, contributing to our open source repositories, or by building your first application using Echo according to "How to" tutorial.
The full list of current Committee members you can see on the Echo Explorer portal

### Is Echo decentralized?

Similar to existing blockchain protocols, the Echo network is open for anyone globally to join, permission lessly and voluntarily, by running the open source Echo node software. Anyone can become an Echo validator or block producer. The decentralization value is increasing as more people with validating nodes use Echo.

### Is there a set date for Echo and it’s sidechains to go live?

Nowadays, the Echo network is running on a stable test network ("testnet") that has been active for 24 months and has been under active development to create the desktop wallet, mobile wallet, node software, browser extension, developer libraries, and block explorers necessary to interact with the network.
The Echo MainNetwork will launch in October 2020

### Do I need ECHOs to use the Echo Network?

No, you can download the Echo wallet and begin sending and receiving other assets without requiring any ECHO. Transaction fees can be paid in many different currencies and are converted into ECHO by the protocol’s underlying fee pools. Additionally, decentralized applications in Echo can pay for their own execution, so that users aren’t required to individually pay transaction fees.

### What is staking and how do I start using it?

Staking means you contribute to transactions validation before they are added to a block. Thus, you participate in the consensus mechanism. Any Echo account holding a minimum-required balance of tokens can do staking if it runs an echo_node with an authorized account attached to it.

### What is ‘Echo delegate’ and how to become one?

Your account can delegate another account to send messages on your behalf. This consensus algorithm is called ‘Delegated Proof-of-Stake’. Under it, you delegate an authorised node to send messages for you and get your share of the reward for it. You can view this delegate’s ID in the object of your account. By default, your delegate is the account that registered you, but you can change this delegate for another one.

### How to lock your Echo funds to participate in staking?

To increase your chances to get a reward, you have to lock (freeze) your funds in the system for a certain period of time. The more you lock and the longer is this period, the bigger are your chances to participate in the process.

### How to register a token in the Echo network?

First, you have to create an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Then, you can register this token in the Echo network. For it, call the method [register_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#register_erc20_token-account-eth_addr-name-symbol-decimals-broadcast). For this purpose you should specify the account that will be the owner of the token, the address of the contract in Ethereum, the name of the token in Echo, which token will have an abbreviated name in Echo and precision. That to check the registered token, please, use the following methods [get_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_erc20_token-eth_addr_or_id) and [check_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#check_erc20_token-id).
