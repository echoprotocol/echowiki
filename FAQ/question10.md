### Is there a set date for Echo and itâ€™s sidechains to go live?

Nowadays, the Echo network is running on a stable test network ("testnet") that has been active for 24 months and has been under active development to create the desktop wallet, mobile wallet, node software, browser extension, developer libraries, and block explorers necessary to interact with the network.
The Echo MainNetwork will launch in October 2020
