### Do I need ECHOs to use the Echo Network?

No, you can download the Echo wallet and begin sending and receiving other assets without requiring any ECHO. Transaction fees can be paid in many different currencies and are converted into ECHO by the protocol’s underlying fee pools. Additionally, decentralized applications in Echo can pay for their own execution, so that users aren’t required to individually pay transaction fees.
