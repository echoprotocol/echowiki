### What is layer 2 and why Echo is different from other layer 2 solutions?

Layer 2 is used to describe projects and protocols that build on the foundation of existing blockchains to provide new functionality. Some examples include the Lightning network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum. While many popular Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network focus on off-chain transactions or transfers using the same asset, Echo's goal is to connect many different blockchains and enable new functionality with the underlying blockchain assets.
