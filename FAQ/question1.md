### What is Echo?

Echo is a layer 2 overlay network that integrates with existing blockchains to provide interoperability and new advanced scripting features for crypto assets. Similar to how the internet is built in different communication layers and protocols, Echo creates an entirely new layer of communication enabling high-speed assets transfers and runs new types of decentralized applications or "smart contracts" to interact with existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most used, most valuable, and most liquid cryptocurrency. Rather than competing with them as a store of value or currency, Echo integrates with Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable new types of complex applications.
