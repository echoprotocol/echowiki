# Node Config

The node supports two configuration options:

- using the configuration file
- using start arguments

The configuration file is located at $DATADIR as config.ini. The config file will be created automatically when the node starts, if it was not there before. In the file you can find explanations for each parameter.

Use `./echo_node --help` to show all available arguments.
