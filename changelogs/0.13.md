## Full start Bitcoin and Ethereum sidechain

One of the main network updates is full sidechain support, which includes Bitcoin with BTC cryptocurrency and Ethereum with ETH cryptocurrency, sidechain support for ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum.
The details what is the sidechain here https://github.com/echoprotocol/echowiki/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/echo-sidechains-whitepaper.pdf

Testnet uses the Bitcoin Testnet network for BTC sidechain and Ethereum Rinkeby for Ethereum sidechain.
Now interaction with sidechains is available in the Echo mobile wallet:

- **Echo Wallet on Google Play** - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.echo.wallet&hl=en
- **Echo Wallet on App Store** - https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/echo-wallet/id1447877175

In addition, all necessary methods for working with sidechains are available in libraries and frameworks:

- **EchoJS-lib** - https://www.npmjs.com/package/echojs-lib
- **EchoPy-lib** - https://pypi.org/project/echopy-lib/
- **Echo iOS Framework** - https://github.com/echoprotocol/echo-ios-framework
- **Echo Android Framework** - https://bintray.com/echo/mobile/android-framework-stable/3.7.0

Sidechains support will be added for the Desktop Wallet for a while.

## Update PoWR Protocol

In the last two versions, changes and updates were made to the consensus related to its optimization and correction. The main change is the exclusion of the blocks producing by the network without transactions. Now the network goes into standby mode in case of missing transactions in the memory pool. This change allows to optimize networking experience by eliminating unnecessary messages from being sent over the network, and optimize the database size by eliminating the storage of unnecessary blocks. Each block becomes more "expensive" and "significant" which improves the quality of the confirmation of the transaction by subsequent blocks.

See the technical details of the Protocol here - https://github.com/echoprotocol/echowiki/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/powr-whitepaper.pdf

## Change account registration mechanism

The operator of node is given the opportunity to open the account registration through its nodes, paying the cost of registration, receiving for this delegation opportunity to participate in the consensus from the registered account. In order to ensure that users do not abuse the possibility of free registration, each registration now requires some work on the registrar 's side. At the same time, the complexity of the work performed is set up on the side of the node registrar, which allows to reduce or, on the contrary, increase the work time execution and spent resources.

More information about the node startup parameters here - https://docs.echo.org/advanced/node-operators/node-config

## Solidity support up to and including version `0.5.11`

Now Echo supports all versions of Solidity up to and including 0.5.11. For the user in Echo, contracts can be compiled by both the original Solc and Echo-solc, an extended version of solc that has support for additional methods (the list of methods can be seen here - https://docs.echo.org/technologies/evm-support/differences-from-ethereum#new-features-in-solidity).

The relevant list of the supported versions and references to compilers are here - https://echoprotocol.github.io/solc-bin/bin/list.json

## Implementing `edverify` in EVM

As Echo uses `EdDSA` rather `ECDSA`, as in Ethereum, the `ecrecover` method in smart contracts is nonvalid and should not be used. You should use `edverify` method to confirm your account and verify your signature.
Detals - https://docs.echo.org/technologies/evm-support/differences-from-ethereum#edverify

## Change mechanism of work with the contract logs

Now getting contract logs is implemented in a similar way to how it works in Ethereum network with the option of complex filtering by topics.
