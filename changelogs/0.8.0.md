## extensions
Many objects lacked the required `extensions` field, which is of type `flat_set<static_variant<void_t>>`. Added last field in the following operations and objects:

Operations:

balance_claim_operation, committee_member_create_operation, committee_member_update_operation, committee_member_update_global_parameters_operation, create_contract_operation, call_contract_operation, contract_fund_pool_operation, contract_whitelist_operation, custom_operation, fill_order_operation, execute_bid_operation, change_sidechain_config_operation, sidechain_issue_operation, sidechain_burn_operation, vesting_balance_create_operation, vesting_balance_withdraw_operation, withdraw_permission_claim_operation, withdraw_permission_delete_operation

Objects:

account_address_object, account_statistics_object, account_balance_object, account_object, contract_balance_object, contract_object, contract_statistics_object, contract_result_object, block_result_object, eth_address_object, deposit_eth_object, withdraw_eth_object, asset_dynamic_data_object, asset_object, asset_bitasset_data_object, limit_order_object, call_order_object, force_settlement_object, collateral_bid_object, committee_member_object, proposal_object, operation_history_object, account_transaction_history_object, contract_history_object, withdraw_permission_object, vesting_balance_object, balance_object, dynamic_global_property_object, contract_pool_object, transaction_object, block_summary_object, chain_property_object, budget_record_object, special_authority_object, buyback_object

As an example of use `extensions` - `asset_create_operation`.

## price_per_kbyte
Of options `fee` in operations `transfer_operation, override_transfer_operation, withdraw_permission_claim_operation` field is removed `price_per_kbyte`.

## chain_parameters
Field is added to the `sidechain::erc20_config erc20_config` after `sidechain_config`.
```cpp
struct erc20_config
{
    std::string contract_code;
    uint64_t create_token_fee;
    std::string transfer_topic;
    eth_method check_balance_method;
    eth_method burn_method;
    eth_method issue_method;
};
```

## contract_object
Moved field `type`
```cpp
class contract_object
{

    echo::vm::vm_type type;
    bool destroyed = false;
    contract_statistics_id_type statistics;
    fc::optional<asset_id_type> supported_asset_id;
    fc::optional<account_id_type> owner;

    extensions_type extensions;
}
```

## contract_fund_pool_operation
Moved field `fee`
```cpp
struct contract_fund_pool_operation
{
    asset fee;
    account_id_type sender;
    contract_id_type contract;
    asset value;
    
    extensions_type extensions;
}
```

## contract_whitelist_operation
Moved field `fee`
```cpp
struct contract_whitelist_operation
{
    asset fee;
    account_id_type sender;
    contract_id_type contract;

    set<account_id_type> add_to_whitelist;
    set<account_id_type> remove_from_whitelist;
    set<account_id_type> add_to_blacklist;
    set<account_id_type> remove_from_blacklist;

    extensions_type   extensions;
}
```

## contract_update_operation
Added a new operation to update the contract owner.
```cpp
struct contract_update_operation : public base_operation
{
    asset fee;
    account_id_type sender;
    contract_id_type contract;
    
    fc::optional<account_id_type> new_owner;

    extensions_type extensions;
};
```

## account_statistics_object

Added fields `generated_eth_address`, `committeeman_rating`. New field order
```cpp
class account_statistics_object
{
    account_id_type  owner;
    account_transaction_history_id_type most_recent_op;
    uint32_t total_ops = 0;
    uint32_t removed_ops = 0;
    uint32_t total_blocks = 0;
    share_type total_core_in_orders;
    share_type lifetime_fees_paid;
    share_type pending_fees;
    share_type pending_vested_fees;
    bool generated_eth_address = false;
    int64_t committeeman_rating = 0;
    extensions_type extensions;
};
```

## account_address_create_operation
Changed parameters `fee`:
```cpp
struct fee_parameters_type
{
    uint64_t fee             = 5*ECHO_BLOCKCHAIN_PRECISION; ///< the cost to register the cheapest non-free account
    uint32_t price_per_kbyte = ECHO_BLOCKCHAIN_PRECISION;
};
```

## committee_member_create_operation
Field `eth_address` now a set of bytes serialized as `vector<char>` of size 20.

## committee_member_update_operation
Field `new_eth_address` now a set of bytes serialized as `vector<char>` of size 20.

## withdraw_eth_operation
Field `eth_addr` now a set of bytes serialized as `vector<char>` of size 20.

## register_erc20_token_operation
Used to register a token in the sidechain.
```cpp
struct register_erc20_token_operation
{
    asset fee;

    account_id_type account;
    eth_address_type eth_addr; // address of the contract in ethereum

    extensions_type extensions;
};
```

## deposit_erc20_token_operation
An internal operation by which committee members confirm the entry of tokens.
```cpp
struct deposit_erc20_token_operation

    std::string value;
    sha256 transaction_hash;

    extensions_type extensions;
};
```

## withdraw_erc20_token_operation
Executed by the user and initiates the withdrawal of the token from the Echo network to the specified address.
```cpp
struct withdraw_erc20_token_operation
{
    asset fee;

    account_id_type account;
    eth_address_type to; // withdrawal address
    erc20_token_id_type erc20_token; // contract id of the token
    std::string value;

    extensions_type extensions;
};
```

## approve_erc20_token_withdraw_operation
