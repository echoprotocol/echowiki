## New objects order
```cpp
enum object_type
{
    null_object_type,
    base_object_type,
    account_object_type,
    asset_object_type,
    force_settlement_object_type,
    committee_member_object_type,

    contract_result_object_type,
    block_result_object_type,
    eth_address_object_type,
    deposit_eth_object_type,
    withdraw_eth_object_type,
    OBJECT_TYPE_COUNT ///< Sentry value which contains the number of different object types
};
```
```cpp
enum impl_object_type
{
    impl_global_property_object_type,
    impl_dynamic_global_property_object_type,
    impl_reserved0_object_type,      // formerly index_meta_object_type, TODO: delete me
    impl_asset_dynamic_data_type,

    impl_contract_history_object_type,
    impl_contract_statistics_object_type,
    impl_account_address_object_type,
    impl_contract_pool_object_type
};
```

## Private and public keys format
Slightly changed the format of the keys:
- For public keys, the prefix has changed from `DET` to `ECHO`
- Private keys no longer have a prefix

## sidechain::config
Added field `eth_update_add_method`. New field order:
```cpp
struct config
{
    std::string eth_contract_address;
    eth_method  eth_committee_update_method;
    eth_method  eth_gen_address_method;
    eth_method  eth_withdraw_method;
    eth_method  eth_update_addr_method;
    std::string eth_committee_updated_topic;
    std::string eth_gen_address_topic;
    std::string eth_deposit_topic;
    std::string eth_withdraw_topic;
    graphene::chain::asset_id_type ETH_asset_id;
}
```

## account_object
- Field `ed_key` renamed `echorand_key`.
- Removed field `memo_key`

## eth_address_object
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## deposit_eth_object
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## withdraw_eth_object
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## asset_issue_operation
- Removed field `memo`

## transfer_operation
- Removed field `memo`

## override_transfer_operation
- Removed field `memo`

## withdraw_permission_claim_operation
- Removed field `memo`

## generate_eth_address_operation
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## create_eth_address_operation
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## withdraw_eth_operation
- Field `acc_id` renamed `account`

## registration_api

### register_account
In the method `register_account` removed fields `owner`, `memo`.

## database_api

### get_required_fees
Changed the result returned `get_required_fees` for the operation `call_contract_operation`
```cpp
struct fee_result 
{
    asset fee;
    asset user_to_pay;
};
```
`fee` - total Commission for execution. `user_to_pay` commission is paid by the user.

In the transaction, as before, you need to set `fee`. Field `user_to_pay` - information.

Changes due to the fact that added new functionality pool contract: https://echo-dev.io/developers/smart-contracts/fee-pool/.

## Added new methods:

## Sidechain

```cpp
/** Returns information about generated eth address, if then exist and approved, for the given account id.
*
* @param account the id of the account to provide information about
* @returns the public eth address data stored in the blockchain
*/
optional<eth_address_object> get_eth_address(const account_id_type& account) const;

/** Returns all approved deposits, for the given account id.
*
* @param account the id of the account to provide information about
* @returns the all public deposits data stored in the blockchain
*/
std::vector<deposit_eth_object> get_account_deposits(const account_id_type& account) const;

/** Returns all approved withdrawals, for the given account id.
*
* @param account the id of the account to provide information about
* @returns the all public withdrawals data stored in the blockchain
*/
std::vector<withdraw_eth_object> get_account_withdrawals(const account_id_type& account) const;
```

## Added operations

## sidechain_issue_operation
Virtual operation, which reports that the money entered with the help of sidechain
```cpp
struct sidechain_issue_operation {
    asset               fee;

    asset               value;
    account_id_type     account;
    deposit_eth_id_type deposit_id;
}
```

## sidechain_burn_operation
Virtual operation, which reports that the conclusion was successful and funds burned(withdrawn)
```cpp
struct sidechain_burn_operation {
    asset                fee;

    asset                value;
    account_id_type      account;
    withdraw_eth_id_type withdraw_id;
}
```

## New functionality

## Contract pool
https://echo-dev.io/developers/smart-contracts/fee-pool/
### database_api

Added methods in database_api to work with the pool contract

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Get an contract's pool balance in default asset
 * @param id ID of the contract to get balances for
 * @return Balances of the contract
 */
asset get_contract_pool_balance(contract_id_type id) const;

/**
 * @brief Get an contract's whitelist and blacklist
 * @param id ID of the contract to get balances for
 * @return struct contract_pool_whitelist which consist of whitelist blacklist
 */
graphene::chain::contract_pool_whitelist get_contract_pool_whitelist(contract_id_type id) const;
```

## New operations

## contract_fund_pool_operation
The operation is required to be able to replenish the contract pool, with which you can pay for user calls to the methods of this contract.
```cpp
struct contract_fund_pool_operation 
{
    account_id_type sender;
    contract_id_type callee;
    asset fee;
    asset value;
}
```

## contract_whitelist_operation
The operation is required to manage the blacklist and whitelist pool of the contract.
```cpp
struct contract_whitelist_operation
{
    account_id_type registrar;
    contract_id_type contract_to_modify;
    asset fee;

    set<account_id_type> add_to_whitelist;
    set<account_id_type> remove_from_whitelist;
    set<account_id_type> add_to_blacklist;
    set<account_id_type> remove_from_blacklist;
}
```
