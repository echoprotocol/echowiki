# ERC20

To start using ERC20 sidechain firstly you need to create your own ERC20 token in echo network. After you create your token in Ethereum you can register it in echo network via method [register_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#register_erc20_token-account-eth_addr-name-symbol-decimals-broadcast). After you call this method your token will be registered in echo network. You can get it via method [get_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_erc20_token-eth_addr_or_id) or check for existence via method [check_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#check_erc20_token-id). After registering your ERC20 token to start using your tokens in echo network you need to transfer money to your sidechain deposit address. Info about creating of the sidechain deposit address you can get in the following article: [Ethereum sidechain](eth.md). After certain amount of time after deposit you can get your balance in your tokens via methods [list_id_balances](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#list_id_balances-id) and [list_account_balances](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#list_account_balances-id) or observe all your deposits via method [get_erc20_account_deposits](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_erc20_account_deposits-account). When you decide to withdraw your ERC20 tokens back to Ethereum network you can use method [withdraw_erc20_token](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#withdraw_erc20_token-account-to-erc20_token-value-broadcast). After withdrawal you will receive ERC20 tokens to specified address after certain amount of time and your balance in your tokens in echo will decrease. To observe all withdrawals you can use method [get_erc20_account_withdrawals](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_erc20_account_withdrawals-account).
