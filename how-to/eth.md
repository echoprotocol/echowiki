# Ethereum Sidechain

To start using ethereum sidechain firstly you need to create your own deposit address. You can use method [create_eth_address](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#create_eth_address-account-broadcast) to create deposit address. After you call this method you will get your own btc address which will be used in btc sidechain and can be observed via method [get_eth_address](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_eth_address-account). After receiving your address to start using your btc tokens in echo network you need to transfer money to your sidechain deposit address. After certain amount of time after deposit you can get your balance in eETH via methods [list_id_balances](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#list_id_balances-id) and [list_account_balances](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#list_account_balances-id) or observe all your deposits via method [get_account_deposits](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_account_deposits-account-type). When you decide to withdraw your eBTC tokens back to Bitcoin network you can use method [withdraw_eth](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#withdraw_eth-account-eth_addr-value-broadcast). After withdrawal you will receive ETH to specified address after certain amount of time and your balance in eETH in echo will decrease. To observe all withdrawals you can use method [get_account_withdrawals](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#get_account_withdrawals-account-type). If you are a committee member and want to change the address of sidechain contract in Ethereum network you can use method [propose_eth_update_contract_address](/api-reference/echo-wallet-api/README.md#propose_eth_update_contract_address-sender-expiration_time-new_addr).
