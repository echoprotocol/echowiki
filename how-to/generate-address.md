# Generating an Address

## General Description

The payment identification mechanism in Echo is implemented by creating unique addresses for a single account. This enables receiving payments to a single account, providing users with different addresses to identify them or identify the product/object this payment is related to.

Generated addresses are an alias for an account and are regarded by the network as transfers between the sender and the recipientâ€™s account who owns this address. Addresses can only be used to receive payments and cannot be used to send outgoing payments.

## API Methods and Operations

### Generation

To generate an address, the `account_address_create_operation` must be sent from the account you want to create a new address for. Using this operation, you can specify a `label` - a string value that will be bound to the generated address.

IMPORTANT: the `label` associated with the address will be seen by all members of the network and is not a private information.

### List All Addresses

In order to get the list of addresses for the account, use the API method `get_account_addresses(account_id,from,limit)`. The method will return all the addresses associated with the account and their labels if they were specified.

### Find an Account by Its Address

Use the API method `get_account_by_address(address)` to find an account by its address.
